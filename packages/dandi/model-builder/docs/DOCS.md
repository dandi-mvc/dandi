## ModelBuilder

The [[ModelBuilder]] interface exposes two methods for working with models.
[[ModelBuilder.constructModel]] is used for converting a POJO ("Plain
Old JavaScript Object") into an instance of a desired model class. 
[[ModelBuilder.constructMember]] is used to convert individual values to
a specified type.

## ModelBuilderOptions

Providing options to `constructModel` or `constructMember` calls will
allow you to configure validation, transform the keys of your source
object, or for `constructModel`, transform the source object itself
before construction.

- **`validators`:** An array of [[ModelValidator]] instances that will be
  used to validate the constructed model.
- **`keyTransform`:** A `KeyTransformFn` that will be used to modify the
  keys of the source object when mapping properties to the constructed
  model. This is useful when dealing with external data sources that
  provide data is in one case (e.g. `snake_case`), and your models are
  written in another (hopefully, `camelCase`).
- **`dataTransformers`:** An array of [[DataTransformer]] instances that
  will modify the source object before starting construction of the model.
  This can be used to do just about anything, but as an example, it can
  be used with [[@dandi-contrib/data-pg]] and [[NestedKeyTransformer]] 
  to convert a flat POJO with dot notated keys to a complex object with
  nested properties.

## MetadataModelBuilder

[[MetadataModelBuilder]] is the default implementation of [[ModelBuilder]]
and is included in the [[@dandi/model-builder]] package.

[[MetadataModelBuilder]] uses the metadata generated by using decorators
from [[@dandi/model]] to define a model. Some things to note about using
[[MetadataModelBuilder]]:

- Nested models are supported - it will recurse into each complex type
  and convert any properties defined by the [[@dandi/model]] decorators.
- When using the `keyTransform` option, it will _not_ transform the keys
  of `Map` properties (defined with [[@MapOf()]]), or JSON properties
  (specified by adding [[@Json()]]).
