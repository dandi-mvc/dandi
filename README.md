Dandi is a modular DI and MVC application framework designed to make it easier to write RESTful APIs, console
applications, and other services for NodeJS with TypeScript. It is split into modules to allow developers to use only
the features they require.

[Get Started](./packages/dandi/core)

## Use Cases
- MVC-style Application Servers
- CLI Applications
- AWS Lambda functions

## Features

### Dependency Injection

- Modeled after [Angular](https://angular.io)'s dependency injection system
- Inject dependencies into class constructors or methods
- 3rd party dependencies can be configured to be injected with Providers

### HTTP Pipeline

- Standalone pipeline for handling and responding to HTTP requests
- Automatic input content negotiation based on request `content-type` header
- Automatic output content negotiation based on request `accept` header
- Create and configure interdependent middleware handlers (`HttpPipelinePreparer`) and they will automatically be
  invoked in the correct order
- Add global transformers to control response data structure  

### MVC

- Modeled after [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview)
- Builds on functionality of `@dandi/http-pipeline` to add routing and other MVC features
- Web framework agnostic - Built for [Express 4](https://expressjs.com/), but can be used with other frameworks if desired
- Decorator-based route configuration
- Automatic path parameter, query parameter, and body model mapping and validation
- Support for automatically generating [HA JSON](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) output

### Model Building and Validation

- Robust set of decorators for defining models and validation metadata
- Automatically construct model class instances from JSON objects or POJOs
- Convert from objects using a different property key casing
  (e.g. `snake_case` to `camelCase`)

### AWS Lambda

- Wraps `@dandi/http-pipeline` for use with handline AWS Lambda requests
- Use the same framework, models, and add-ons (`HttpPipelinePreparer`, `HttpPipelineResultTransformer`) between your
  Lambda functions and MVC API

### Misc

- `Disposable` interface and utilities for managing disposable resources
- Uses [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) as a replacement for Date objects
- Models can be reused between backend NodeJS and frontend TypeScript/JavaScript applications
- `Uuid` class based on the [uuid](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid) library for working with and comparing UUIDs.
